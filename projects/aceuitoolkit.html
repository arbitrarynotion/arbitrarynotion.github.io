					<h2>Project Summary</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="description">
					<div class="content">
						<p>
							Accessible Custom Editor (ACE) UI is a <b>Unity development toolkit that streamlines custom
							editor creation</b> and provides <b>real-time custom UI manipulation
							and visualization features</b> for both game script properties and custom UI layout.
						</p>

						<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
						<p>
							I embarked on this solo project to <b>address my frustration with the default way UI is
							drawn for custom game scripts in Unity</b>. When exposing script properties (settings) to the Inspector
							(the in-engine game script UI),
							the <b>grouping and labeling options are very limited and produce UI
							that can be difficult to visually parse</b>. More effective UI such as
							indented, fold-able groups and disabling UI elements via a checkbox do exist within
							Unity's custom editor library, but <b>there is no simple and efficient way to access these advanced options</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The need for one of these options on even a single property requires writing a boilerplate-heavy custom
							editor script where every property must be manually identified, loaded, and drawn.
							As a result, <b>a Unity programmer is left with only two options: accept game script UI
							that is functional but difficult to work with or write a time-consuming and tedious
							custom editor script to improve the user experience</b>.
						</p>

						<p>
							ACE UI solves these problems by taking the following steps to improve the game script UI experience
							for both the programmer and the user.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Improving the Programmer's Experience</b>
								<p>
									Through a custom editor framework ACE UI automates the finding and loading of
									game script properties and provides a
									suite of grouping and labeling functions that <b>require no custom editor script or code to
									access</b>. It further simplifies the process by requiring only grouping to be
									specified, relegating all look and feel settings to an in-editor settings window.
								</p>

							</li>

							<li>
								<b>Improving the User's Experience</b>
								<p>
									All default custom UI layout settings are relegated to reusable Themes which
									are edited using a Theme Settings window in Unity. Edits to these settings
									are rendered in real-time, promoting experimentation through immediate feedback,
									and empowering the user to define the UI look and feel that works for them.
								</p>
							</li>

					<div class="content">
						<p>
							Following is a high-level list of the key components that I completed for this project:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Custom editor framework</b> that handles all custom editor code and includes
								library functions that provide advanced custom UI functionality
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Bridge that connects Unity runtime scripts to Unity Editor functionality</b>
								without breaking builds by including editor code in runtime scripts
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>System that stores all UI element types as objects</b> with their properties
								linkable to properties within a Theme
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Theme system that links all relevant properties within all assigned custom
									game scripts to a theme</b>, syncing updates in real-time in both edit and play mode
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Theme Manager</b> that finds all custom game scripts utilizing ACE UI and assigns
								themes via an editor window within Unity
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Theme Settings window</b> that utilizes its own ACE UI theme to present all the
								settings in the active theme
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Conversion to distributable package via GitHub and Unity Package Manager</b> with
								automatic version control using Semantic Release
							</li>

					<h3>Custom Editor Framework</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="description">

					<div class="content">
						<p>
							The <b>two key goals of this project</b> were to <b>make custom editor creation more efficient</b>
							and to provide grouping and labeling options to <b>make custom UI creation more versatile</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							To address the inefficiency issue, <b>I developed a framework to automate handling of Serialized
							Properties</b>. This framework <b>utilizes inheritance and reflection to facilitate custom
							editor creation within the game script itself</b>. That is, the game script inherits from a root
							script and specifies how its properties will be grouped by providing implementation
							for an inherited, abstract method.
						</p>
						<p>
							With the custom editor creation simplified, I then developed a hierarchy of Element
							Info objects designed to contain all relevant data to draw various UI elements and
							an associated library of custom editor functions to provide grouping and labeling options.
						</p>
						<p>
							With these systems in place, <b>a game script could specify exactly how its
							properties should be drawn in Unity's UI, including grouping and labeling options,
							with very little code, no additional scripts, and no editor code required</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							See the class diagram below for a high-level overview of how this system works.<br>

					<h3>Realtime UI Customization Tool</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="description">

					<div class="content">
						<p>
							While developing the framework for this project, <b>I continually tested my approach</b> to
							determine what was the best way to simplify the process of creating a custom editor
							without sacrificing the flexibility attained by manually writing a custom editor script.
							It was through this testing that <b>I realized that putting the default layout settings for
							custom UI elements into the user's hands</b> would not only <b>improve the programmer's experience
							by requiring less code to be written</b>, it would <b>support accessibility
							by empowering the user to choose the UI look and feel that works best for them</b>.
						</p>

						<p>
							To implement this approach, I created the following components:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Theme system</b> to store settings presets in a portable and reusable format
								that can be applied to multiple game script UIs simultaneously
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Theme Settings window</b> to facilitate real-time theme settings editing while
								Unity is in either Edit or Play mode
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Theme Manager window</b> that:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Lists all game scripts utilizing the ACE UI framework
									</li>
									<li>
										Shows what theme has been assigned to each game script
									</li>
									<li>
										Facilitates theme reassignment, updating all attached game script UIs
										in real-time
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

							I feel that the best way to showcase the effectiveness of this toolkit is to <b>show it
							having a positive impact in a practical application</b>.
						</p>
						<p>
							After completing this ACE UI's core features, I resumed development on my
							<a href="spacesim.html"><b>Space Sim</b></a> since it's complex, multi-component
							procedural generation system would <b>provide an excellent real-world use case and
							stress test for ACE UI</b>. With the framework, I was able to <b>produce complex game
							script UIs that exceeded what was possible with Unity's default custom editor scripting
							while taking a fraction of the time to produce</b>. I was then able to <b>create a unified
							look and feel across all components</b> by creating and adjusting a custom Theme.
						</p>

<!--							<br>-->
<!--							<b class="note">(Compare default Inspector to ACE UI Inspector if time permits)</b>-->
<!--						</p>-->

						<p>
							Applying ACE UI to Space Sim's game scripts <b>helped me identify and address many edge
							cases that I'd missed during testing</b>, allowing me to <b>further refine and polish the
							framework</b>. This also highlighted the need for various additional features including
							rendering game script data as real-time UI graphs, which I was able to quickly
							implement since I'd designed the framework to be extensible.
						</p>

						<p>
							The following video shows how I utilized ACE UI to not only organize the Resource
							Manager's many settings into meaningful groups, but I also render the resulting
							resource generation into a graph displaying resource distribution counts in real-time.
