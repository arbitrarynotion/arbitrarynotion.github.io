									Accessible Custom Editor (ACE) UI is a <b>Unity development framework that streamlines custom
									editor creation</b> and uses its structured approach to provide <b>in-editor realtime data visualization features</b>.
								</p>
								<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									When writing a custom game script in Unity, I typically have two goals in mind. The first, is-->
<!--									the obvious goal of writing code that provides the desired functionality efficiently and-->
<!--									"well" (clean code, etc.). The second goal is to ensure that the functionality the script provides-->
<!--									is fully customizable from within the Unity editor. When the functionality is complex, this can-->
<!--									involve many controls which, due to few formatting options being available by default, can quickly-->
<!--									become difficult to visually parse.-->
<!--								</p>-->
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									The solution in such situations is to write a custom editor script as it allows direct control-->
<!--									over how the script's data is displayed in the Inspector. However, this process involves-->
<!--									writing a large amount of boilerplate code -->
<!--								</p>-->
<!--								-->
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									When writing custom game code for Unity, beyond the obvious goal of developing the desired-->
<!--									functionality with code that is efficient and well written, it's often equally important to-->
<!--									ensure that functionality is fully customizable via settings displayed in the Inspector window-->
<!--									when an object using the game script is selected within Unity. While the way those settings are-->
<!--									displayed by default is sufficient for very simple scripts, it quickly becomes cumbersome when-->
<!--									the script's functionality involves many settings. Writing a custom editor for each script, which-->
<!--									provides direct control over how script data is displayed, can solve this issue but these extra-->
<!--									scripts involve significant boilerplate code and many common features such as min/max sliders have-->
<!--									to be custom-built with each script.-->
<!--								</p>-->

								<p>
									When I write a custom game scripts for Unity, I typically have two goals in mind. The most obvious
									goal is to create the desired functionality efficiently while <b>enabling customization by providing
									access to key settings</b>. The second, often overlooked goal, is to ensure that those <b>settings are
									displayed in an intuitive and accessible way</b>. While this can be somewhat managed with the use
									of headers, to provide a bit of visual separation, and tooltips, to provide explanations, <b>settings
									can quickly become difficult to visually parse</b>.
								</p>

								<p>
									To address this pain point, I first explored writing custom editor scripts which allow a high
									degree of control over how a custom game script is displayed. However, one of these custom editor
									scripts must be created for every custom game script, each involves a significant amount of
									boilerplate code, and some very useful features used throughout the Unity editor must be hand-built.
								</p>

								<p>
									After writing many of these time-consuming and redundant custom editor scripts, I decided to develop <b>a framework that would
									automate the boilerplate code</b> and <b>provide simple access to the more advanced UI features</b>.
									Once this framework was in place, I then expanded it to provide real-time data visualization features.
								</p>

<!--								<h4>Description for Context</h4>-->
<!--								<p></p>-->

								<p>
									As this framework is a developer tool but this page may be viewed by non-devs, I'll provide
									a quick explanation of the workflow this framework is targeted at improving.
								</p>

								<h4>Context for Non-devs</h4>
								<p>
									Developing a game in Unity often involves writing custom game scripts to build a game's intended
									functionality. The scripts are then added to object's within the Unity editor and displayed in
									as special editing window referred to as the "Inspector", a part of the Unity interface which displays
									a selected object's attached scripts as "Components". A custom game script has the option of
									exposing parts of its data to be displayed as settings in the inspector, those settings allowing
									a Unity developer to adjust the behavior of the game script without having to modify the script's code.
								</p>

								<h4>Accessible UI is Important!</h4>

								<p>
									The number of settings displayed in the Inspector is determined by the game script, which is in turn
									a reflection of the functionality the script provides.

									While the functionality a game script provides should be focused and of reasonable scope, even a simple
									script may involve many settings to ensure its behavior is flexible. Thus, its not uncommon to
								</p>


								<h4>The Problem this Framework Solves</h4>

								<p>
									The pain point this framework addresses is the way custom game script settings are displayed
									in the Inspector. By default, without writing extensive extra editor code for each game script to
									manually guide how settings are drawn, the settings get clumped together in a way that can
									be difficult to visually parse. In particular, there is no easy way to group settings into
									sections that can be folded (hidden under a heading) or toggled (enabled/disabled as a group).
									Further, the size and spacing between settings can not be easily changed to accommodate
									differences in visual comprehension.
								</p>

								<p>
									To address these pain points, ACE UI provides <b>a framework that
									automates boilerplate code</b>, facilitates <b>real-time Inspector layout modifications</b>, and
									simplified

									As my first major project after graduation, my goal was to spend about 3 months developing a solid portfolio piece that
									would push me to expand my Unity knowledge and provide a solid example of what I can do. However, beyond those priorities,
									I had a lot of freedom on where to take this project. I also had a lot of challenges to face as a solo developer
									with a solid Computer Science education but little real-world experience.
