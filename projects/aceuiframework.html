									Accessible Custom Editor (ACE) UI is a <b>Unity development framework that streamlines custom
									editor creation</b> and provides easy access to <b>real-time data manipulation and visualization features</b>.
								</p>
<!--								<h4>Project Purpose</h4>-->
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									When writing a custom game script in Unity, I typically have two goals in mind. The first, is-->
<!--									the obvious goal of writing code that provides the desired functionality efficiently and-->
<!--									"well" (clean code, etc.). The second goal is to ensure that the functionality the script provides-->
<!--									is fully customizable from within the Unity editor. When the functionality is complex, this can-->
<!--									involve many controls which, due to few formatting options being available by default, can quickly-->
<!--									become difficult to visually parse.-->
<!--								</p>-->
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									The solution in such situations is to write a custom editor script as it allows direct control-->
<!--									over how the script's data is displayed in the Inspector. However, this process involves-->
<!--									writing a large amount of boilerplate code -->
<!--								</p>-->
<!--								-->
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									When writing custom game code for Unity, beyond the obvious goal of developing the desired-->
<!--									functionality with code that is efficient and well written, it's often equally important to-->
<!--									ensure that functionality is fully customizable via settings displayed in the Inspector window-->
<!--									when an object using the game script is selected within Unity. While the way those settings are-->
<!--									displayed by default is sufficient for very simple scripts, it quickly becomes cumbersome when-->
<!--									the script's functionality involves many settings. Writing a custom editor for each script, which-->
<!--									provides direct control over how script data is displayed, can solve this issue but these extra-->
<!--									scripts involve significant boilerplate code and many common features such as min/max sliders have-->
<!--									to be custom-built with each script.-->
<!--								</p>-->

<!--								<p>-->
<!--									When I write a custom game scripts for Unity, I typically have two goals in mind. The most obvious-->
<!--									goal is to create the desired functionality efficiently while <b>enabling customization by providing-->
<!--									access to key settings</b>. The second, often overlooked goal, is to ensure that those <b>settings are-->
<!--									displayed in an intuitive and accessible way</b>. While this can be somewhat managed with the use-->
<!--									of headers, to provide a bit of visual separation, and tooltips, to provide explanations, <b>settings-->
<!--									can quickly become difficult to visually parse</b>.-->
<!--								</p>-->

<!--								<p>-->
<!--									To address this pain point, I first explored writing custom editor scripts which allow a high-->
<!--									degree of control over how a custom game script is displayed. However, one of these custom editor-->
<!--									scripts must be created for every custom game script, each involves a significant amount of-->
<!--									boilerplate code, and some very useful features used throughout the Unity editor must be hand-built.-->
<!--								</p>-->

<!--								<p>-->
<!--									After writing many of these time-consuming and redundant custom editor scripts, I decided to develop <b>a framework that would-->
<!--									automate the boilerplate code</b> and <b>provide simple access to the more advanced UI features</b>.-->
<!--									Once this framework was in place, I then expanded it to provide real-time data visualization features.-->
<!--								</p>-->

<!--								<h4>Description for Context</h4>-->
<!--								<p></p>-->

								<p>
<!--									As this framework is a developer tool but this page may be viewed by non-devs, I'll provide-->
<!--									a quick explanation of the workflow this framework is targeted at improving.-->
									As this framework is a developer tool, a little developer context may be helpful.
								</p>

								<h4>First, A Little Context</h4>
								<p>
									Developing a game in Unity often involves <b>writing custom game scripts to build a game's intended
									functionality</b>. The scripts are then added to object's within the Unity editor and displayed in
									a special editing window referred to as the "Inspector", a part of the Unity interface which displays
									a selected object's attached scripts as "Components". <b>A custom game script has the option of
									exposing parts of its data to be displayed as settings</b> in the Inspector, those settings <b>allowing
									a Unity developer to adjust the behavior of the game script without needing to engage with the
									script's code</b>.
								</p>

								<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
								<p>
<!--									Settings are a vital part of ensuring that a game script's functionality is flexible enough-->
<!--									to be both customizable and reusable. However, by default, Unity displays script settings-->
<!--									as a single-level stack of labeled fields with-->
									When developing a game solo or on a small team, I'm often playing multiple roles. While I try
									to focus the majority of my effort on programming to keep pushing myself to expand my CS skills,
									I still do a lot of work as an artist and a game developer.


									When writing a game script, I have two high-level goals in mind:

<!--								Ensure that the in-editor settings for my script are displayed in a way that makes-->
<!--								the script's functionality easy to both understand and modify.-->
<!--									ACE UI Framework-->
								</p>

								<ol>
									<li>
										Provide the required functionality <b>efficiently with clean and maintainable code</b>.
									</li>

									<li>

										Ensure that the script's intended behavior and settings can be <b>easily understood and
										adjusted from within the Unity editor</b>.
									</li>

								</ol>

								<p>
									As a programmer, it can be easy to unintentionally neglect that second goal.
								</p>

								<p>
									However, Unity's default approach to drawing script UI settings produces results
									that can be difficult to visually parse and aren't easily adjusted. While it's possible to improve those
									results with grouping, indenting, and font style adjustments, it can be prohibitively time-consuming as it
									requires a significant amount of additional boilerplate-heavy code which can't simply be reused across multiple scripts.
								</p>

								<p>
									ACE UI addresses these issues by providing <b>a framework that
									automates boilerplate code</b>, is <b>easily reusable across multiple scripts</b>, and even facilitates
									<b>real-time Inspector layout modifications</b>.
								</p>

								<h4>Accessible UI is Important!</h4>

								<p>
									The number of settings displayed in the Inspector is determined by the game script, which is in turn
									a reflection of the functionality the script provides.

									While that functionality should be focused and of reasonable scope, even a simple
									script may involve many settings to ensure its behavior is flexible. Thus, its not uncommon to
								</p>


								<h4>The Problem this Framework Solves</h4>

								<p>
									The pain point this framework addresses is the way custom game script settings are displayed
									in the Inspector. By default, without writing extensive extra editor code for each game script to
									manually guide how settings are drawn, the settings get clumped together in a way that can
									be difficult to visually parse. In particular, there is no easy way to group settings into
									sections that can be folded (hidden under a heading) or toggled (enabled/disabled as a group).
									Further, the size and spacing between settings can not be easily changed to accommodate
									differences in visual comprehension.
								</p>

								<p>
									To address these pain points, ACE UI provides <b>a framework that
									automates boilerplate code</b>, facilitates <b>real-time Inspector layout modifications</b>, and
									simplified

									As my first major project after graduation, my goal was to spend about 3 months developing a solid portfolio piece that
									would push me to expand my Unity knowledge and provide a solid example of what I can do. However, beyond those priorities,
									I had a lot of freedom on where to take this project. I also had a lot of challenges to face as a solo developer
