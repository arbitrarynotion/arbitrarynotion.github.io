									Space Sim is a <b>space-themed, AI bot-driven,
									procedurally generated, dynamic game economy simulation</b>
									developed with the <b>Unity Game Engine</b>.
								</p>

								<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
								<p>
									<b>The purpose of this solo project has been to get some hands-on experience with solving the
										challenges involved with creating a virtual world</b>. In this context, a virtual world is
									a game world that grows and evolves with or without player input and persists regardless
									of player presence. While my initial work on this project was for a course at my university,
									my fascination with the topic has since brought me back to continue exploring the idea.
								</p>

								<h4>Economy Description</h4>
								<p>
									As the economy comes into play in many of the descriptions on this page, it'll help to have a little
									context for how it works.
								</p>
								<p>
									The economy consists of raw resources, in the form of gases and minerals gathered from gas
									clouds and asteroids respectively, and products manufactured at factories contained within
									space stations. Said products then become the resources for more advanced factories whose products
									also become the resources for other factories and so on. The scope of this simulation includes
									four tiers of manufacturing, starting with the processing of raw resources and ending in the
									production of new ships at a shipyard.

									This is a complex project consisting of many parts and systems, but following is a high-level list
									of the main building blocks.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>A hierarchy of goods</b> ranging from basic minerals and gases, collected in space, to high-tech goods produced at the end of a series of
										processing space stations.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A grid system to simplify the game world object placement</b> and ensure solid performance by facilitating efficient data structures and
										search algorithms.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A procedurally generated resource placement system</b> to distribute gas clouds and mineral rich asteroids automatically in a way that
										looks organic and can be adjusted to produce interesting game play scenarios.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A production facility placement algorithm</b> that can analyze the existing resources and production facilities and determine the best
										placement of new facilities to maximize the resource utilization across industries.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A Stock and Worker Management system</b> that monitors factory stock levels, places orders
										for stock as needed, and tasks workers with fulfilling those orders.
									</li>
									<li><b>Intuitive factory and worker in-game UI</b> that provides all the info required to monitor
										the economy simulation as it plays out.</li>

							<div class="content">
								<p>
									A key decision I needed to make going into this project was <b>how to handle the placement of the
									asteroids and gas clouds</b>. As they represented both the most prominent visual feature of the game
									and the foundation of the game's simulated economy, I needed a placement system that could
									provide flexibility in both categories.
									<br><br>
									To solve this problem, I decided to build <b>a tool that utilized procedural generation to populate
									the game world dynamically</b>. More specifically, a tool that uses a noise map and a suite of settings
									to determine resource placement algorithmically.
								</p>
								<p>
									See the videos below for a demonstration of how this tool works.

							<h3>Stock Management System</h3>
						</div>

						<div class="description">

							<div class="content">
								<p>
									To automate the game's economy, I developed an <b>AI system that monitors stock levels
									in each space station and manages the workforce</b> to ensure shortages are dealt with.
									When a resource is needed, an order is placed. The system then periodically scans for
									other space stations that produce the needed resources, spacing out the scans to avoid
									impacting the game's performance.
									<br><br>
									Once a space station that has the desired resource in stock is found, an idle worker
									is assigned to perform the collection. When the
									worker returns and deposits the resources, the order is marked as complete, and the
									process begins again. <b>All of this activity is displayed in an in-game UI so that
									the player can see how stock is being managed</b>. Additionally, I developed a code-based
									animation system for the docking arms which, together with animated landing lights and
									in-world UI, clearly communicate how a station's local traffic is being handled.

							<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

						<div class="description">

							<div class="content">

								<p>
									When concluding work on a project, I often find myself thinking about what I would
									do different given the chance to start over with what I'd just learned. One of my favorite
									things about this project was how it gave me a chance to explore that idea in practice; to
									<b>see just how much I could improve on my previous work</b>.
								</p>

<!--								<p>-->
<!--									While there are many aspects I could talk about here, I'll focus on just two for the sake-->
<!--									of brevity.-->
<!--								</p>-->

								<h4>Taking Responsibility for Previous Code</h4>
								<p>
									Though <b>I always strive to write code in a way that is self-documenting and easily
									understood</b>, I don't often get the chance to really put that work to the test. When
									revisiting this project, I had to work with code that I'd written over a year early, so
									I often needed to rebuild my understanding of exactly what the code was doing. Though
									I found some of my previous efforts helpful, I also found some lacking which <b>prompted me
									to develop several improvements in code organization and documentation</b> moving forward.
								</p>

<!--								<h4>Favor Composition over Inheritance</h4>-->
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									A common theme in my early work was an over reliance on inheritance to reduce code-->
<!--									repetition and combine shared behaviors. Though I was aware of this guideline, that-->
<!--									composition is often a more flexible and maintainable solution than inheritance, It-->
<!--									wasn't until my work developing my ACE UI Toolkit that I experienced the inflexibility-->
<!--									of inheritance firsthand. That experience led me to rely more on composition when-->
<!--									resuming work on this project.-->

							<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						</div>

						<div class="description">

							<div class="content">

								<p>
									This project has been, and continues to be, <b>a fantastic source of learning</b> for me.
									This includes working in Unity, both in-editor development and writing custom editor
									code, and developing game functionality through custom scripts in C#.
									There have been so many challenges both big and small and each has been its own little
									adventure with struggles, epiphanies, and triumphs.
								</p>

								<p>
									Between my love for the topics covered here (game dev, programming, space simulations,
									procedural generation, AI, etc. ) and the sense of accomplishment and growth I've
									felt throughout development, I would gladly dedicate more time to this project.

									<li> <b>Navigation using Unity's NavMesh system</b>, baked at runtime after procedurally generated resources are instantiated to incorporate their static positions without the performance hit of NavMesh Obstacles.</li>
									<li> <b>Camera layering</b> to create the illusion of a background of nebulas and planets.</li>
									<li> <b>Built-in Renderer Post Processing</b>.</li>
									<li> <b>Addressing performance issues with Unity's Profiler</b> both in-editor and in-game.</li>
									<li> <b>Developing specialized logging tools</b> to streamline debugging with toggleable, class-specific and color coded console output.</li>
									<li> <b>Developing procedural generation algorithms</b> that must perform quickly while minimizing performance impact to show results in real-time.</li>
									<li> <b>Developing in-game searching algorithms</b> for locating resources without impacting performance.</li>
