						<div class="description">
							<div class="content">
								<p>This group research project, composed of myself and two other students, was developed to <b>explore how medical diagnosis training
									simulation could be improved using procedural generation</b>. As a lead programmer on
									this project, I designed and implemented the procedural generation algorithm that
									generated patient scenarios, wrote the associated documentation, helped develop the
									statistical analysis system, and co-authored the (unpublished) research paper.</p>

								<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
								<!--								<h5>Research</h5>-->
								<p>
									Through our research, we determined that <b>existing medical diagnosis training
									simulations had some shortcomings</b>. We found that the best training simulation
									available, which involved using specially trained actors, was <b>cost-prohibitive and
									inflexible</b> and existing <b>computerized solutions failed to capture the complexity of a
									real-life patient scenario</b>.
								</p>

								<!--								<h5>Hypothesis</h5>-->
								<p>
									With this knowledge, we hypothesized that <b>a key weakness of existing computer simulations was
									that their patient scenarios were one-dimensional, resulting in testing that mostly focused on memorization</b>.
									A real-life patient is more complicated as they have a history consisting of events that can
									effect their chances for developing, and resisting, various ailments. For example, factors such as
									past illnesses, living conditions, economic standing, education, family relations,
									etc. can make a patient more or less likely to experience physical or mental illness.
									Taking these factors into consideration when simulating patient scenarios could provide
									<b>more meaningful medical training that could facilitate more than just memorization
										testing</b>, introducing greater nuance and ambiguity by simulating causality.
								</p>

								<h4>Application Development</h4>

								<p>To test this hypothesis, we developed a <b>medical diagnosis training application in Unity</b>
									where a trainee could <b>interview a procedurally generated patient, choose a diagnosis,
										and review the accuracy of their decision</b>.

								<p>
									To simulate a patient, I first worked with my team to develop a sufficiently detailed
									patient model.

									As the central goal to this project was to <b>generate a patient that
									meaningfully influenced the quality of diagnosis training</b>, I designed a system which
									<b>produced the patient's history as a collection of life events applied chronologically</b>.
									By determining the probability of event occurrences based on existing conditions,
									this Life Event system <b>simulated cause and effect</b>, giving each event context.
									As a result, the medical event that brought the patient to the doctor's office <b>could
									have many factors influencing its inception, the expression and severity of its
									symptoms, and its overall duration</b>.

<!--									As the central goal to this project was to generate a patient with a history that-->
<!--									meaningfully effected diagnosis, I designed the Life Event system.-->
<!--									This system produced the intended impact on diagnosis by building a patient's-->
<!--									history chronologically as a series of life events applied conditionally. That is,-->
<!--									each event applied would affect the probability of future events simulating cause-->
<!--									and effect. As a result, the medical event that brought the patient to the doctor's-->
<!--									office may have many factors influencing its inception, the expression and severity-->
<!--									of its symptoms, and its overall duration.-->

<!--									The Life Event system pulls from a collection of events split into categories-->
<!--									including medical, relations, education, career, and habits. To ensure that the-->
<!--									system could be easily extended and modified, I designed it to pull its events from-->
<!--									a pool of Scriptable Objects.-->


<!--									I further augmented causality by including hereditary and contagious events. By-->
<!--									generating the patient's parents, spouse, and children first, the patient's probability-->
<!--									to experience various life events could be affected by the past events of their-->
<!--									parents and/or the contemporary events-->

										</a>
<!--									</div>-->

								</div>

								<p>
									To further deepen the aspect of causality, I also designed the system to take
									hereditary events into consideration. By generating the patient's
									parents first, then taking their histories into consideration when processing
									the patient's history, life events with a hereditary aspect can become more likely.

									An key challenge <b>when developing a system based heavily on probability</b> is <b>ensuring
									that the results it produces make sense</b>. To this end, I developed a <b>testing program
									to produce a large batch of patients</b> to be fed into a system that my team
									developed to <b>export the results to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis</b>. We then set up the
									spreadsheet to do automatic calculations and display the relevant data including
									the average and standard deviation for ranged values, the counts and occurrence
									rates for events, and a combined number to give the batch of patients an overall
									diversity a rating. This analysis <b>helped us identify behavior that didn't make sense</b>,
									like rare diseases occurring too frequently, and <b>adjust event probabilities to
									get more realistic results</b>.

								<!--								<h4>The Application</h4>-->
								<p>
									As a Computer Science research project, <b>our goal with this project was to develop a
									hypothesis and then build an application to test it</b>. While
									the heart of this application was the planner that I developed, several other components
									were needed to create the context to effectively test it. These components,
									which my teammates developed, included locating and placing 3D assets to build the doctor's office
									scene, implementing a dialog system, developing a patient names database for
									the planner to pull from, and a clipboard UI to display the information collected from the patient.
								</p>

								<p>
									When interviewing a patient, <b>the player must discover the particulars of the scenario
									by asking questions</b>, with the data collected being automatically recorded on an on-screen
									clipboard. When the player has exhausted their options or feels that they have enough
									information to submit a diagnosis, they select the suspected ailment from a list of
									possibilities and a message is displayed evaluating their choice.

									University research projects are often developed over time as they get passed from

									this project started a novel approach to diagnosis, <b>we laid the groundwork by building
									a proof of concept that demonstrates the project's potential</b>. While I would have
									loved to continue development, refining the procedural generation system, adding features
									that I had to cut to keep the scope in reach, and get to see how medical students reviewed our work,
									<b>it's satisfying to know that I made a meaningful contribution to a project
