						<h2>About me</h2>
					</header>
					<p>From the first time I saw video games as a kid, staring up at an NES demo in an electronics store, they've both fascinated and inspired me. Over the years, I've eagerly followed their evolution, repeatedly blown away by how they somehow just keep getting more awesome. Naturally, I often wanted to get involved in their creation and start contributing to the medium I loved but without access to education and equipment, it was just a poor kid's pipedream. </br></br>
						That all changed when I got the chance to get into modding for a PC game. Intoxicated by the possibilities, I shrugged off my near total ignorance of coding and I threw myself wholly into learning all that I could. Before long, I was hooked and my love for coding was born. When I finally found the means to attend college, I dove at the opportunity, earning a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Game Development.</br></br>
						As a game developer, the aspect of games that has intrigued me the most, and thus become the focus of my game programming work, are the complex systems that enhance immersion and make game worlds feel more alive. This has led me to pursue procedural generation for its power to produce content both organically and efficiently and NPC AI to make inhabitants of a world and their interaction with the player more interesting and believable.</br></br>
						As a programmer, I'm always striving to improve my skills and to write better code. I'm also very mindful of what makes a job fulfilling.  To me, this means working to bring my team together, writing code thatâ€™s not only effective but considerate, and fostering inclusion and growth by sharing knowledge openly and enthusiastically. When it all comes together, nothing beats the feeling of knowing that I made a positive difference.
