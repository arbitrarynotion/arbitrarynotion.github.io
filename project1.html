								<p>
									Space Sim is <b>a Unity game that simulates a dynamic economy in a space-themed, AI bot-driven,
									procedurally generated world</b>.
								</p>


<!--								<h4><strong>Definitions</strong></h4>-->
<!--								<p>-->
<!--									For the sake of clarity, there are a few terms that should be defined to provide context for-->
<!--									the rest of this page.-->
<!--								</p>-->
<!--								<ul>-->
<!--									<li>-->
<!--										The word "Wares" refers to the items that are consumed and/or produced within the economy.-->
<!--									</li>-->
<!--									<li>-->
<!--										The word <b>"Resources" refers to gas clouds and-->
<!--										asteroids that exist within the game world</b> to be mined and processed into-->
<!--										tradable wares at factories.-->
<!--									</li>-->
<!--									<li>-->
<!--										Resources are processed into tradable wares at facilities that are interchangeably-->
<!--										referred to as either "Space Stations" or "Factories".-->
<!--										<b>Space stations are also referred to as factories</b> as they all consume either resources-->
<!--										or tradable wares to manufacture their own tradable wares.-->
<!--									</li>-->
<!--								</ul>-->
								<h4>Project Purpose</h4>
								<p>
									<b>The purpose of this solo project has been to get some hands-on experience with solving the
										challenges involved with creating a virtual world</b>. In this context, a virtual world is
									a game world that grows and evolves with or without player input and persists regardless
									of player presence. While my initial work on this project was for a course at my university,
									my fascination with the topic has since brought me back to continue fleshing out the idea.
								</p>

								<h4>Economy Description</h4>
								<p>
									As the economy comes into play many of the descriptions on this page, it'll help to have a little
									context for how it works.
								</p>
								<p>
									The economy consists of raw resources, in the form of gases and minerals gathered from gas
									clouds and asteroids respectively, and products manufactured at factories contained within
									space stations. Said products then become the resources for more advanced factories whose products
									also become the resources for other factories and so on. The scope of this simulation includes
									for tiers of manufacturing, starting with the processing of raw resources and ending in the
									production of new ships at a shipyard.

								<p>
									This is a complex project consisting of many parts and systems, but here is a high-level list
									of the main building blocks.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>A hierarchy of goods</b> ranging from basic minerals and gases, collected in space, to high-tech goods produced at the end of a series of
										processing space stations.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A grid system to simplify the game world object placement</b> and ensure solid performance by facilitating efficient data structures and
										search algorithms.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A procedurally generated resource placement system</b> to distribute gas clouds and mineral rich asteroids automatically in a way that
										looks organic and can be adjusted to produce interesting game play scenarios.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A production facility placement algorithm</b> that can analyze the existing resources and production facilities and determine the best
										placement of new facilities to maximize the resource utilization across industries.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A factory placement algorithm</b> that can efficiently identify the best placement of new factories to maximize
										resource utilization within the game world.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>A Stock and Worker Management system</b> that monitors factory stock levels, places orders
										for stock as needed, and tasks workers with fulfilling those orders.
									</li>
									<li><b>Intuitive factory and worker UI</b> that provides all the info required to monitor
										the economy simulation as it plays out.</li>

							<h3>Resource Generation System</h3>
						</div>

						<div class="description">

							<div class="content">
								<p>
									A key decision I needed to make going into this project was <b>how to handle the placement of the
									asteroids and gas clouds</b>. As they represented both the most prominent visual feature of the game
									and the foundation of the game's simulated economy, I needed a placement system that could
									provide flexibility in both categories.
									<br><br>
									To solve this problem, I decided to build a tool that utilized procedural generation to populate
									the game world dynamically. More specifically, a tool that uses a noise map and a suite of settings
									to determine resource placement algorithmically.

							<h3>Stock Management System</h3>
						</div>

						<div class="description">

							<div class="content">
								<p>
									To automate the game's economy, I developed an AI system that monitors stock levels
									in each space station and manages the workforce to ensure shortages are dealt with.
									When a resource is needed, an order is placed. The system then periodically scans for
									other space stations that produce the needed resources, spacing out the scans to avoid
									impacting the game's performance.
									<br><br>
									Once a space station is found that has the desired
									resource in stock, an idle worker is assigned to perform the collection. When the
									worker returns and deposits the resources, the order is marked as complete, and the
									process begins again. All of this activity is displayed in an in-game UI so that
									the player can see how stock is being managed.

							<h2>Results</h2>

						<div class="description">

							<p class="content">
								The culmination of the systems I've developed result in a virtual economy that develops over time without player input or intervention.
								Starting with production facilities in place and AI ships ready to work, the world immediately comes to life with mining ships gathering resources.

							<p class="content">
								Before long, basic production facilities are in full production and cargo ships start distributing their products - bringing more advanced
								industries online. Eventually, high-end products are being manufactured and the game world buzzes with activity as dozens of ships busy themselves
								keeping their respective industries fed.

							<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
						</div>

						<div class="description">

							<div class="content">

								<p>
									This project has been, and continues to be, <b>a fantastic source of learning</b> for me.
									This includes working in Unity, both in-editor development and writing custom editor
									code, and developing game functionality through custom scripts in C#.
									There have been so many challenges both big and small and each has been its own little
									adventure with struggles, epiphanies, and triumphs.
								</p>

								<p>
									Between my love for the topics covered here (game dev, programming, space simulations,
									procedural generation, AI, etc. ) and the sense of accomplishment and growth I've
									felt throughout development, I would gladly dedicate more time to this project.
